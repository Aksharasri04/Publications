## Introduction
   In the face of the escalating global issue of air pollution, affecting millions worldwide, the application of deep learning technologies has emerged as a promising solution to detect and forecast metropolitan air quality. This approach relies on vast datasets, amalgamating air quality measurements and meteorological variables collected from government monitoring stations and citizen scientific initiatives. Utilizing deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, enables the accurate prediction of air pollution levels by analyzing complex time-series data patterns. Through meticulous data preprocessing and training processes involving backpropagation and gradient descent, these models learn to optimize their parameters and bridge the gap between predicted and actual pollution levels. The resulting trained LSTM network becomes a powerful tool, offering timely and precise predictions based on current meteorological and environmental factors, ultimately contributing vital insights into urban air quality and aiding in the preservation of our planet's health.
